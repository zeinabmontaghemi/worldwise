# Overview
This project is a single-page application built with React and Vite. Designed for tracking your travel adventures, it features a world map where users can click on a location to see the city name and corresponding country flag. The site allows you to write notes for the cities youâ€™ve visited, set the date of your visit, and save these details in a city list. The application utilizes React Router, Context API, and useCallback for efficient state management and navigation. URL-based state management is implemented, and a custom JSON server is used to store and fetch city data.
